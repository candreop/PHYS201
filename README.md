# PHYS201 (Electromagnetism I) 

This repository includes the source code for my PHYS201 (Electromagnetism I) lectures delivered at the University of Liverpool from 2014/15 to date. PHYS201 is a 15-credit, second-year undergraduate module attended by about 150 students from several courses, including Physics, Mathematical Physics, Astronomy, Geology, Ocean Sciences and Medical Physics. The 12 2-hr lectures represent 50% of scheduled contact time, with the rest devoted to workshops.

# Aims of the course

- To introduce the fundamental concepts and principles of electrostatics, magnetostatics,
electromagnetism and Maxwell's equations, and electromagnetic waves.
- To introduce differential vector analysis in the context of electromagnetism.
- To introduce circuit principles and analysis (EMF, Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's rules, RC and RLC circuits)
- To introduce the formulation of Maxwell's equations in the presence of dielectric and magnetic materials.
- To develop the ability of students to apply Maxwell's equations to simple problems involving dielectric and
magnetic materials.
- To develop the concepts of field theories in Physics using electromagnetism as an example.
- To introduce light as an electromagnetic wave.
